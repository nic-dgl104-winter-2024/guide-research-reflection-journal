# Research and Reflection Journal Guide
_A guide to writing an effective Research and Reflection Journal_

## Introduction
The Research and Reflection Journal (and repository) is a tool used throughout the remainder of the semester to document the work you do and the reflections you generate. For me, this document is the primary record that I will have of your process throughout the latter half of DGL 104; for you, it should be a record of all the efforts you've put into the course. Taken together, you should recognize that this is not a project to ignore!

You can use this guide as a model for how to complete weekly entries in your own Research and Reflection Journal. It is not intended to be prescriptive, however! Please take any approach you like to completing your own Journal, as long as it meets expectations! 

## Expectations
First, you should definitely read, in full, the assignment description and rubric posted on Brightspace. You will have work to complete in your journal every week (in particular, see the weekly REQUIRED activities). You are absolutely welcome (and encouraged!) to add _more_ than just the bare minimum (i.e., complete RECOMMENDED activities, and add other research and reflections as you see fit).

For the purposes of this guide, however, I will focus on the high-level expectations with an example of a single week's work. Your Research and Reflection Journal should be:
- Well-organized (so that I understand what day/week or assignment I am reading about)
- Informative (each entry should clearly indicate tasks and activities you've participated in)
- Reflective (each entry should demonstrate that you've reflected on the tasks and activities you've participated in)
- Complete (the journal should represent a complete accounting from week 8 through the end of the semester; it must also include a bibliography and in-text citations, where necessary).
- Well-formatted (I should be able to read the journal easily)

## How to use this repository
This repository contains:

1. This guide (README.md) demonstrating how to meet the criteria above via example.
2. A CONTRIBUTING.md document that also demonstrates the information that should be included there for the purposes of the Community Code Project - Part 1. 

I've included process notes in blockquotes below. These may help you interpret how best to write your own journal entries.

There is no need to clone this repository (unless you find any mistakes, and you'd like to generate a pull request to fix them! Bonus marks are available as bounty for fixes!)

## Week 8 - Research and Reflection activities 

> Make sure to use appropriate headings for each section!

### Research a new language

- Language: [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- Useful resources:
    - [Haskell Wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell)
    - [Building web apps with Haskell](https://haskell.dev/article/Building_web_applications_with_Haskell_A_beginners_guide.html)
    - ["Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!"](https://www.learnyouahaskell.com/)
Interesting facts:
    - [Haskell on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell)
    - [Haskell on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/haskell)

Some notes:
    - Haskell is a purely functional programming language
    - Often used for research
    - Has been used more for production development in recent years
    - Learning functional programming can be really hard when your experience is purely in object-oriented programming

## Conclusion
The example above is a good approximation of what you should be doing on a weekly basis. Remember that the written work you do here is a record of the actual research work you've done, so feel free to use the document as a place to store notes and to commit changes with improvements and updates as you progress. In fact, check out the commit history for this README.md to see what I mean!

Hopefully this has been a helpful read for you! If you have questions, please get in touch!
